<h1>Quickstart</h1>

<h2>Opening a connection</h2>

<p>Use this code to open a connection to our WebSocket service (in Javascript):</p>

<pre data-language="javascript">var ws = new WebSocket('wss://ws.binaryws.com/websockets/v3?app_id=XXX');</pre>

<p>After opening a connection, you can send data through the WebSocket using the method calls from our <a href="/api">API playground</a>.</p>

<p>Data transfer in both directions is handled by structured <a href="/schemas">JSON-encoded data</a>.</p>

<p>All field name identifiers and most field values are double-quoted in the encoded data.</p>

<h2>App ID</h2>

<p>Youâ€™ll get your app ID when you register your app with us.</p>

<h2>Code samples</h2>

<p>See our <a href="/demos">code samples</a> in languages other than JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Multi-language support</h2>

<p>To receive responses in other languages, add the language code to the connection URL:</p>

<pre data-language="javascript">var ws = new WebSocket('wss://ws.binaryws.com/websockets/v3?app_id=XXX&l=RU');</pre>
