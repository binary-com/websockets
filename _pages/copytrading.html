<h1>Copy trading facilities</h1>

<h2>
    What is it?
</h2>
<p>
    Copy Trading is becoming popular in the financial markets; it allows a client (the Copier) to automatically copy the trades of another client (the Trader).
</p>

<h2>
    Becoming a Trader
</h2>
<p>
    To become a Trader (i.e. to allow others to follow your trades), set the “allow_copiers” setting via https://developers.binary.com/api/#set_settings
</p>
<p>
    The Trader then creates a read-only API token and provides it to the Copier.
</p>
<p>
    Enabling the allow_copiers setting will also make the <a href="https://developers.binary.com/api/#copytrading_statistics">copytrading statistics</a> call work. The statistics API call provides the information about an account (this is so that potential copiers have an idea about the trader’s past performance).
</p>

<h2>
    Becoming a Copier
</h2>
<p>
    To become a copier, use the <a href="https://developers.binary.com/api/#copy_start">copy start</a> call.
    To stop copying, use the <a href="https://developers.binary.com/api/#copy_stop">copy stop</a> call.
