<h1>Omnibus account facilities</h1>

<h2>
    What is an Omnibus Broker?
</h2>
<p>
    The Omnibus Broker facility is available to approved Binary.com partners, who are appropriately licensed and regulated brokers.
    In the Omnibus Broker account structure, all trades are placed by you on behalf of your clients, who are unknown to Binary.com.
</p>

<h2>
    How do I apply to become an Omnibus Broker?
</h2>
<p>
    If you are a licensed and regulated broker in your home jurisdiction, you may apply by contacting our <a href="mailto:affiliates@binary.com">Affiliate Manager</a>.
</p>

<h2>
    How does the Omnibus Broker facility work?
</h2>
<p>
    Once approved, your Binary.com account becomes the <b>omnibus master account</b>. All incoming deposits and outgoing withdrawals should be made from this account.
    You may then create <a href="https://developers.binary.com/api/#new_sub_account">sub-accounts</a> which will hold records of the trades made on behalf of your clients.
    You may transfer funds to/from your master account and sub-accounts using the <a href="https://developers.binary.com/api/#transfer_between_accounts">account transfers</a> call.
</p>

<h2>
    Transacting on sub-accounts
</h2>
<p>
    To create transactions in sub-accounts, you will need to use the <a href="https://developers.binary.com/api/#api_token">API token</a> facilities.
    The Oauth facility does not work with sub-accounts.
</p>
